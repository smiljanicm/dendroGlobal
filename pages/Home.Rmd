<h2> Welcome to DENDROUGHT 2018! </h2>

<p>
This is a platform for the upload of automatic dendrometer measurements with sub-daily temporal resolution and relative metadata for the assessment of trees species responses to the extreme 2018 summer heatwave in a large part of Europe.
</p>

<p>
DENDROUGHT 2018 is a follow up initiative of activities initiated during the <a href='http://streess-cost.eu/'>COST Action STReESS</a>. The initiative is currently animated by a group of about 20 researchers from 8 different European Research Institutions (see contact for more details) who intend to join forces to advance understanding of tree-responses to extreme climatic events by specifically focusing on the effects of the 2018 European summer drought. 
</p>

<h3> Analysis </h3>

<p>
Analyses will be oriented at assessing the timing and strength of the drought impact on the treesâ€™ water status and dynamics of seasonal stem growth from measurements of stem size variation measured with high-resolution dendrometers. 
</p>

<p>
Results of this European-wide study are expected to be published in a high-ranked peer reviewed scientific journal. Kathy Steppe, Patrick Fonti and Ute Sass-Klaassen will lead the work and all contributors with adequate data will be asked to participate as co-authors in the expected publication.    
</p>

<h3> Data colection </h3>

<p>
Data and metadata will be collected, stored and analysed exclusively for the above described DENDROUGHT 2018 research initiative. For detailed information check Data policy.
</p>

<p>
Please carefully read the instructions before initiating the uploading process! Well prepared and cleaned data and metadata will save you a lot of time!
